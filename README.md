# Real-Estate-Analysis

## 🎯 Objective  
Analyze and visualize **House prices** using **Python and Power BI** to uncover:
- Price drivers and key influencing factors  
- Impact of property features on market value  
- Neighborhood-based price differences  
- Business-ready insights for decision-making

## 📊 Overview  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from **data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Python** to building **interactive Power BI dashboards**.  
The analysis uses the **Housing dataset (Kaggle)** and focuses on understanding **housing market behavior** through business-oriented visuals.

## ⚙️ Process  

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Dropped columns with more than 20% missing values  
- Handled missing values using:  
  - Median for numerical features  
  - Mode for categorical features  
- Converted data types (numerical vs categorical)  
- Standardized and cleaned categorical values  
- Identified and handled outliers using the **IQR method**  
- Renamed columns for clarity and business readability

### 2. 🧩 Data Analysis & Modeling  
- Prepared **clean, analysis-ready data** for Power BI

### 3. 📈 Visualization  
- Built **interactive Power BI dashboards**  
- Created **DAX measures and KPIs**  
- Designed dashboards focused on **business storytelling**

## 🧠 Tools & Features  
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** | Data cleaning |
| **Power BI** | Data modeling, DAX & dashboards |
| **Power BI DAX** | KPIs & calculated measures |
| **Interactive Filters** | Dynamic data exploration |

## 🔍 Key Insights  

### 💵 Market Overview  
- **Newer homes** tend to sell at higher prices  
- **Remodeled homes** command a pricing premium  
- **Build quality** has a strong positive relationship with sale price  

### 🏘 Price Drivers  
- Neighborhoods such as **NoRidge** and **NridgHt** achieve the highest prices  
- **Living area** increases price, but very large homes show diminishing returns  
- **Single-family homes** outperform duplexes and condos  
- **Higher quality homes** consistently command higher prices  

### 🏠 Interior Layout & Space  
- Prices increase with more bedrooms up to a point, then flatten  
- **Full bathrooms** add more value than half bathrooms  
- **Above-ground living area** is a key driver of home value

## 🏁 Conclusion  
This project highlights how **Python and Power BI** can be combined to deliver a **complete analytics solution** — from **raw data cleaning and EDA** to **business-ready dashboards** — providing insights that support **smarter real-estate decisions**.
